## Clone and Run Locally

This repo is a monorepo with two packages

1.  The CLI (`packages/xplora-cli`)
2.  The Frontend (`packages/frontend`)

### Install dependecies

This uses [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to intall dependecies for each package in their [respective directories](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/)

```
yarn
```

### Run test

```
 yarn test
```

### Build a distributable version

```

### Development

```

This spins up:

- A react react app in development mode
- A nodejs server listening on port `3001` 

## TODO

- [ ] Write more test cases
- [ ] Front end theming
- [ ] Make frontend more accessible
- [ ] Use Typescript in the CLI package
- [ ] Make the CLI more interactive
