## Clone and Run Locally

This repo is a monorepo with two packages

1.  The CLI (`packages/xplora-cli`)
2.  The Frontend (`packages/frontend`)

### Install dependecies

This uses [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to intall dependecies for each package in their [respective directories](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/)

```
yarn
```

### Run test

```
 yarn test
```

### Build a distributable version

```
yarn build
```

### Testing `xplora-cli` lacally

### Development

```
yarn develop

This spins up:

1. A Frontend dev server with react scripts. It makes an API to server to fetch files
2. A nodejs server listening on 3001. It broadcasts a `CHANGE` event with socket.io when changes occur

## TODO

- [ ] Write more test cases
- [ ] Front end Theming
- [ ] Make frontend more accessible
- [ ] Add Typescript to CLI code
- [ ] Make CLI more interactive
